# Music Bot
- One of my old first javascript projects however due to changes with youtube's copyright this may no longer work.
- Add your user ID in index.js and add your bot token in botconfig.json
- Great for servers with a large amount of players due to a voting system.

- Help command listing all commands
- Leave command to leave the current voice call
